# Starter Energy via Biomass

Before you get coal power, your energy needs will be met by using the Biomass Burner building and burning leaves, wood, biomass or solid biofuel.  The Hub building contains a pair of 20MW Biomass Burner units, but you will want to construct additional burner units as you have time and materials.

## Fuel Types

- Wood/leaves: Set aside any wood until later, and only burn leaves until you can make "biomass".
- Biomass: Made from various things (wood, leaves, etc.), this is more efficient.
- Solid Biofuel: The most efficient fuel for burners in the early game.

## Tips

- Setup a (container -> constructor -> container) manufacturing line early so that you can convert leaves into biomass without doing it at the Craft Bench.  Expand the manufacturing line to then convert Biomass into Solid Biofuel once that is unlocked.

- Keep below 100MW energy consumed while using burners.  Work on getting towards coal power.  Harvesting and refueling by hand is time-consuming.

- A single Solid Biofuel manufacturing line can keep up with about 15 burners operating at 100% capacity.  But you'll be spending all your time harvesting leaves and wood and then refueling the burners.

- Biomass Burner units only consume fuel at the required rate.  If you have 300MW of capacity from Biomass Burner units, but are only consuming 75MW of power (25% of burner capacity), then the burner will consume fuel at a 25% rate. 

- Constructing additional burners is recommended to reduce the frequency of refueling.  It does not reduce your fuel consumption per hour, but only having to refuel every 2-6 hours is a nice quality-of-life enhancement in the early game.  I recommend building out 8-16 burners until you get coal power up and running.

- Once you have coal power, keep the burners around but locate them (and your solid biofuel factory) near your first coal plant.  Having a spare 240-480 MW of fueled but idle burners makes it easier to deal with something going wrong in the coal plant.
