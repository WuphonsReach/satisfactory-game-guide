# Coal Plants

## Footprint

Each coal plant is a bit over 1x3 tiles.  A good rule of thumb is that you need 1.5 x 4 tiles for each.  Plus another 3 tiles for the water pipes for a total of 1.5 x 7 tiles per plant.  

For the starter build with Mk1 pipes, you'll usually build (8) coal plants and feed them via (3) water extractors.  That gives a total footprint of 12x7, but you should probably build out a 13x8 or 14x8 foundation layer.  You can do a depth of 7 foundation tiles, but you have to be really good about minimum distances between things in your piping.  Especially when you are using both fluid buffers and valves in front of each coal plant.
