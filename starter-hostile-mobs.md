# Hostile Fauna Spawns

A powered building (Smelter, Power Storage, Miner, etc.) will prevent respawn of hostile fauna in the area out to a range of about 300m around the building.  The building does not have to be doing any useful work or consuming energy, but it must be wired up to a powered electrical grid.

## Early Game

As you explore, constantly run power lines with poles every 75-90 meters.  When you find and kill a hostile monster, look for a nearby location where a building can be placed.  Such as up against the bottom of a cliff or somewhere that the building is out of the way.  Good buildings to wire up are the Smelter and Constructor as they are both inexpensive.

## Middle Game

Power Storage units are really good choices once you unlock them.  Now you're building in additional backup power and also working on suppressing monster spawns.  You'll probably want dozens of these built anyway, so why not spread them around the map?
