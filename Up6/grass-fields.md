# Grass Fields


## Southeast Grass Fields 

This is the area east/south of the large archway (E of -26, S of 256).

- (1) pure Coal
- (4) normal Limestone
- (1) normal Copper
- (4) normal Iron

The coal node plus two of the iron nodes fit together well for creating Steel Ingot.  None of the nodes are blocked off by boulders, so they can be accessed very early.
